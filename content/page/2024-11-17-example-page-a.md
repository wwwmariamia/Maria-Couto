This series is made up of four portraits of my girl friends, taken on 35mm film during quiet, ordinary moments in our lives.\
Each photograph captures a different mood, I experienced all of these emotions with them, just by being there. These portraits weren’t planned or posed. They came naturally, from being present and sharing time together. The camera became part of our routine, a quiet observer of small gestures, passing light, and everyday closeness.

Spending time with these friends — all women — helped me reflect on my own identity. Girlhood, friendship, and care are all at the heart of this work.\
We listened to each other, laughed, shared silences, and created space for one another. Through that, we created a kind of home between us.

This series is a reflection on presence — on how we live together, hold each other, and find meaning in simple moments.\
It’s about paying attention, and about how connection can grow quietly in the everyday.
