title: Inside Outside
subtitle: What happens in someone’s private space is never fully visible — even
  to those closest to them.  A room is a place of transformation, care, love,
  but also mess and imperfection.  Perhaps it’s true that our rooms reflect our
  state of mind, even if only subtly.

This series of images explores everyday moments within the intimate spaces I shared with my friends while we lived together in a small town near Lisbon.\
They capture traces of personal experience — quiet fragments of life, without any attempt to dramatize or explain.\
The goal is simply to observe and acknowledge, it is important to honor the ordinary moments; an image is a frozen gaze, a tangible memory. This work is about noticing what is shared and allowing ourselves to be fully present.  It’s a record of presence — of being there, paying attention, and honoring those moments.

These photographs were taken during ordinary days spent with two close friends.\
We shared a house, shared spaces, and many quiet, unspoken moments together.\
Nothing was staged — the camera was just there, part of our routine, quietly present in the in-between.

**Shot on Kodak Gold film with my parents’ old analog camera, the process itself was slow and deliberate.\
Each frame carries a sense of care — a reflection of intimacy and the time taken to truly be there.**
