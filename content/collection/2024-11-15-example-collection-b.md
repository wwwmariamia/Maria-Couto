One image shows my sister in our grandparents’ house, she represents home as a living presence, a person who carries that feeling.  Another captures a view of neighboring buildings, sparking curiosity about the lives unfolding behind those windows. There’s a photo of a trailer where I spent a summer with my parents, a space filled with memories and seasonal rhythms. And a simple image of an ashtray in my living room — an everyday object that grounds the feeling of familiarity and comfort.

 Shot on Kodak Gold 35mm film, these photographs reflect personal moments and places that embody what intuitively I experience at home, a concept that intrigues me. These pictures reflect a meditation on the places, people, and spaces that shape our sense of home. What does home really mean? Is it a physical place, a feeling, or perhaps both intertwined?
